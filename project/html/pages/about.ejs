      <p>My name is Rajit and I'm currently a computer scientist who goes to Georgia Tech!</p>
      <p>Anyways, I attended Northeastern University, where I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I love building sweet products for happy customers, and HubSpot is the place I love to do it every day. I haven't built many things of my own, but this sweet sweet site is a ~*~*very~*~*~ basic template that you might use if you were in the market to build out your own personal website. Tabs, styling, the works. Google + bootstrap are your new best friends.</p>
